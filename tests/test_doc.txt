i ate an apple with my parents in the park yesterday. the apple was delicious. i like it. And now i am having dinner, in a restaurant. 

Earlier in the year, I wanted to see a movie with my friends. My friends liked watermelon very much, so before we went to the movie we purchased some watermelons. They were delicious. I think that when I grow up, I want to be a scientist. However, my friend wants to be an artist, and we had an argument about it at the movie theater.
